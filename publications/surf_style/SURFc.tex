In this study we examine the suitability of efficiently inverting, or obtaining
the solution of problems associated with a class of centrosymmetric matrices
which arise from problems associated with stochastic interpolation
on regularly spaced grids. These matrices associated with these linear
systems are full, and thus the usual range of sparse matrix solvers are
not available. In particular, the study focuses directly on the properties
of centrosymmetric matrices as a means to improve the solvability of these
linear systems, showing that for these centrosymmetric matrices of even order
it is possible to achieve a factor of 7/8 improvement in the cost of
matrix inversion using Schur complements. In addition the multiplication
of these matrices can be speeded up by a factor of two by fully utilizing
the block antisymmetry of these matrices.
