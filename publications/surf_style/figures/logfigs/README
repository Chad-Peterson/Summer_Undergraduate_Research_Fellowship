To plot the data using gnuplot, do

 gnuplot < GnuPlot.com

to create the output file, integral.pdf, or plot interactively (if you have
access to the terminal display), using

 gnuplot

then when it comes up, interactively load the file using:

 load GnuPlot.com

Note that the attributes of the plot can be changed by editing the file.
Gnuplot.com.



To plot the data using python, do

 python area_plot.py

and also, 

 python error_plot.py

The output can be selected, however in this case it is more difficult to
construct a combined y-axes plot.
